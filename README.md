## Purpose:

BroskieType.com (not a real website) is a game to test your typing speed and give feedback according to your wpm (words per minute). BroskieType.com (not a real website) uses typeracer rules where you have to correctly type each word, else it won't let you continue. Timing will start as soon as you start typing, and timing will end as soon as you are done. A longer test will result in a more accurate wpm. This is all mentioned in the help screen as well.  

## Running the File  

To open the game, open the project file in vscode (which I assume you will be able to do), and then run the file main.py.  

## Required Installations  

Type in "pip3 install pygame" to install pygame.  
If this doesn't work then refer to requirements.txt
